1. Go to AutoScaling--->Autoscaling groupname:-
        * Switch Launch template to Launch Configration
(If we do not have any launch configration then create it)

*launch configration name:- LC1
*Amazon Machine Image:- copy the id of instance image of linux and paste here, after that we get a option select it.
*instance type:- t2.micro (freely available)
*Security group:-
  create a new security group ( it fill automatic security details )
*Rules

type         protocol   port-range      source-type       source

key pair:-  choose key if present otherwise create a new
 
launch configration.

2. Go to Autoscaling tab--->launch configration-->next-->select all availability zones-->next-->configure group size and scaling policies.
    * desired capacity-->3
    * min capacity---> 2
    * max capacity--->2
create Auto Scaling group.

NOTE:- According to policies the instances are created and it start run.


3. click on created Autoscaling group--->Autoscaling tab-->create dynamic-->scaling policy
     *policy type:- simple scaling
     *scaling policy name:- Increase
take Action
     *Add      2     capacity units
Create

Note:- Again create similar steps for decreasing method.

4. Now go to cloud watch and create alarm.
-------------------------------------------------------
craete alarm--->Ec2--->Autoscaling group--->select CPUutilization of created autoscale group-->select metric-->static.
                *for Increase :- Greater/equal     than  70
                *for decrease :- Lower/equal        than  20

Again go to Autoscaling groups-->click on groups-->Automatic scaling--->then, here saw the Dynamic scaling policy(which is created previous)-->
selectas per requirements-->Action-->edit-->update.
 Note:- go to ec2 and see the no.of instances is decreases.
 Note:-  go to Mobaxterm --->take ssh-->for increase we should increase the stress and we saw the result.
